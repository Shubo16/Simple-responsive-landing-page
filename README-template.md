## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javascript


### What I learned

I have brushed up on some of my javascript skills, that being using the DOM and using functions to make buttons interactive for the user. Ive also gained a greater understanding on stacking elements and positioning. 



### Continued development

I need to understand css positioning a little more especially since i'm also learning transitions and animations to make my websites pop, gaining a better hold of these fundamentals will help me create things with ease and let my creativity flow. Also ned to brush up on some JS.
